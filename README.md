# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects Collection

Welcome to my hands-on machine learning journey!  
In this repository, I'm exploring different ML algorithms by building practical projects step-by-step using Python and scikit-learn.

Each notebook focuses on understanding how models work — not just getting high accuracy, but also interpreting, visualizing, and comparing their behavior.

## 📁 Projects Included

| Project Title | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **1. Predicting Water Temperature from Salinity** | Using simple linear regression to model the relationship between salinity and temperature. |
| **2. Polynomial Regression & Regularization** | Exploring how polynomial features affect regression performance and how regularization (Lasso, Ridge) prevents overfitting. |
| **3. Classification Models Evaluation** | Comparing Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, and Random Forest using confusion matrix, accuracy, and decision boundaries. |
| **4. Linear Regression - Basic** | Understanding the foundations of linear regression using synthetic data. |'
| **5. Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning** | Working on Heart Disease data and make prediction . |'
